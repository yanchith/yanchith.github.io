            I am a systems programmer and an aspiring game maker. Since 2021, I've been leading a
            team of smart programmers at a startup by day, and developing a video game by night.
          </p>

          <p>
            In software engineering I believe in first principles thinking, and that programmers should
            not add artificial complexity to software. I enjoy crafting dedicated
            tools for each project, and when picking off-the-shelf tech, I choose something
            simple, so that it can be customized to the project's needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for video games, I'd like to build stuff I would enjoy playing myself.
            To that end, I like games that mine a lot of experience out of a compact design. I love games
            that encourage experimentation, where you can look back on your journey as a
            player and honestly say that this game changed the way your brain is wired. Here's a
            few games I think do this really well: The  Witness, The Talos Principle, Tunic, Enigmash,
            Animal Well, Outer Wilds.

              <a href="http://qubu.io">Qubu</a> is an ambitious software startup that wants to build
              quality housing for people in the 21st century. Leading the development team there is
              a jack of all trades situation: I read assembly language as well as math papers, I
              write renderers, allocators and code generators. I design how things fit together in
              the ever-shifting mosaic, and I try to be a good friend and mentor to my talented
              programmer colleagues.
