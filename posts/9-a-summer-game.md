In summer of 2025, I found myself with some free time on my hands, and at the same time creatively
unfulfilled. (These are related, but that is a different story.)

I had some money saved up, giving me a few months of runway to make something before having to look
for a new source of income. I have also been playing a lot of Dragonsweeper (XXX: Link) and Dungeons
and Diagrams (XXX: Link) in the preceding months, so my head was full of ideas about deduction and
observation gameplay. On top of that, I have had access to the JAI language beta for quite some
time, and felt bad that I still haven't done a nontrivial thing with it yet.

And thus, a naive motivation came to be: make a game that is like Dungeons and Diagrams, but also
has Dragonsweeper observation gameplay. Also, because this is going to be just a simple 2D game, it
is okay to program it in a language I am not proficient in, so that I can form an informed opinion
on that language.

While it might seem a little like a setup for failure, this is by no means intentional. I'll address
the easy parts first: the programming went well, and I would change nothing about it.

My experience with JAI probably deserves a larger post, but I'll constrain myself. I was productive
with the language, and it felt good to program in! It has rough spots and could use polish in
places, and I was missing the libraries I wrote from my previous projects, but I was almost
instantly productive, and it never forced me to do a huge refactor as a response to a small change
in the code. I believe this is because a deep design principle of JAI is to trust the programmer,
which then surfaces in many of the language's features (or sometimes lack thereof).
