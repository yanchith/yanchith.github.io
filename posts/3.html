          <a href="https://github.com/subdgtl/HURBAN-Selector">H.U.R.B.A.N
          Selector</a> is a software experiment initially funded by
          the <a href="https://www.scd.sk/">Slovak Design Center</a> I worked on
          with Ján Pernecký (<a href="https://sub.digital">Subdigital</a>)
          and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrowan/">Ondrej
          Slinták</a>. It is meant to test the hypothesis that creating new
          designs and shapes is subconsciously inspired by our previous
          experience. There is a trial and error phase in the design process
          where many variations on the same shape are prototyped and chosen
          from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The software currently has many rough edges (mostly on the usability
          side), but it strives to be a tool for simple parametric modeling,
          containing implementations of various morphing strategies for mesh
          models, allowing designers to smoothly interpolate between multiple
          mesh geometries and select the result with the most desired features.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the explicit history lineage
          of <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/">Grasshopper</a>, we
          decided that every decision the user makes in the editor should not
          only be undo-able, but also modifiable at any point. The geometry
          displayed in the viewport is just the result of applying operations on
          the initially empty world. These operations can create or import
          geometry, or transform existing geometries in some way, e.g. perform
          iterative Laplace Relaxation.

        <p>
          Exposing the declarative nature of editing to the user freed us to
          utilize a well specified thought model of having an interpreter that
          evaluates a directed acyclic graph of possibly interdependent
          operations. Naturally, we didn't want to execute the whole graph of
          possibly heavy operations on every change to its definition. Simple
          tricks such as ID-ing the operations instances by their operation type
          and parameter values allowed us to preserve sub-graphs of computation
          from previous interactions and only recompute the minimal necessary
          set of operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was surprised to learn that the UI of some 3D modeling tools
          (e.g. Rhino, Blender) can freeze up when performing computations on
          heavy geometries. We knew from the start that some of the topology
          traversal algorithms necessary to implement the strategy of morphing
          we initially wanted to do won't have great time complexity, and
          therefore opted to run the graph interpreter in its own thread and
          design the UI around this asynchrony from the get-go. As these things
          usually go, we did't implement the topology based approach to morphing
          in the end, but at least as a positive side effect the editor doesn't
          freeze up. Mostly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The editor itself is written in the Rust programming language, with
          the use of a few libraries
          (<a href="https://github.com/subdgtl/HURBAN-Selector/blob/master/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a>).
          This certainly proved to be a lot of work, but has paid of in some
          areas - for instance our implementation of some geometry algorithms
          already outperforms Rhino. Overall the balance between using existing
          solutions and making something from scratch is tough to strike.
        </p>

        <p>
          H.U.R.B.A.N. Selector proved to be a lot of work and as our funding
          was nearing end, we had to sacrifice some of the things we wanted to
          do. Most notably, we are really unhappy with the current user
          interface. One of the first things we would do when working on the
          project again would be to openly admit to and promote the graph
          structure of the geometry definition, and allow the user to model
          geometry via a node-based programming environment similar to
          Grasshopper or Unreal Blueprints.
