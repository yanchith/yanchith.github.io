          I am particularly proud of my contribution to the realization of
          <a href="https://cfoeg.online">celestialfruit.org</a> with
          <a href="https://jonathanreus.com">Jonathan Reus</a>. The
          installation is an ongoing and open interactive artwork. It’s
          conceived as a living tapestry of visual and sonic traces gathered
          through artistic collaborations and micro-commissions.

          The work focuses on the five-string banjo, a historically complex
          musical instrument that can be thought of as a map of
          material-embodied cultures, packed with the stories and ideas of
          people; their migrations and exchanges. Moving around through an
          online virtual universe, the visitor navigates and reassembles these
          elements in a way that mirrors the transmission and transformations of
          culture itself as a living, moving, and complex entity. Besides the
          interactive experience, the work also operates as a method and engine
          for driving future collaborations at the meeting points of musical
          instruments, technology, and tradition.

          This collaboration flexed my programming muscles in more than one
          way. It might be my first finished project where experimentation and
          changing the feature set regularly was the go to modus operandi
          instead of something unwelcome. During the three-month initial
          development period, I had to keep some semblance of structure while
          not overoptimizing or locking myself into a design corner. It sort of
          worked and I am not terribly unhappy with the resulting codebase,
          although the amount of cleanup tasks this produced is daunting. I am
          sure I'll get to that backlog one day (:

          Having to implement a data driven scene building system and an
          animation system with simple scripting all over again makes me think
          whether I should finally bite the bullet and learn a game engine like
          Godot or Unreal instead of always rolling my own. I do admit that the
          tight time constraints made me step outside of my comfort zone and use
          way more framework-ey libraries than I otherwise would. The experience
          was as expected: there were a lot of out-of-the-box features, and a
          lot of out-of-the-box bugs. If I had to guess, the features still
          outweighted the extra trouble, even if it made me grumpy at times.
