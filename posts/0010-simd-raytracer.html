          This is an article about fast raytracing on the CPU. Because we are going to be focusing
          on fast for most of the article, there will be assumptions of raytracing, math and
          programming knowledge. To not leave people behind, I'll explain some basics as we go, but
          to get deeper understanding, I wholeheartedly recommend doing your own research. A good
          place to start is the <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Raytracing Weekend book
          series</a>. For computer knowledge, my long-form recommendation for the patient viewer is
          Casey Muratori's <a href="https://guide.handmadehero.org/">Handmade Hero</a>
          and <a href="https://computerenhance.com">Computer Enhance</a> series.

          The article stems from work I did in early 2023. As of the time of writing (December
          2025), that work is still the most focused nugget of technical work I have done. This was
          quite the luxury for me as I usually don't get to concentrate on doing single part of a
          larger system well, and instead have to prioritize what is the most valuable thing to work
          on. This was a happy and rare exception. Also note that I am a generalist, and don't
          consider myself deeply knowledgeable in computer graphics. I am painfully aware that I
          could have missed an obvious technique that could have made the results better. I'd be
          happy to receive your email with any feedback on the technical (and non-technical)
          contents of this article.

          Now, before we get to the core of the problem, here's the last bit of context. In early
          2023, a startup company I worked for was about to get funding, and we wanted to warm up
          the programming team on a thing we knew we were going to need before fanning out and
          developing the rest. The goal of the company was to give real estate developers tools to
          procedurally generate housing architecture. This housing was supposed to meet the
          developer's criteria, such as yields, mix of functions and apartment sizes, aesthetics, as
          well as spatial instructions (e.g. build here but not there, build in this shape...). We
          assumed that to generate the architecture, there would be a computer learning process. As
          it is with learning processes, they need to get feedback on their results from one
          iteration that can be fed into the next, gradually improving the results. Architecture is
          a very high-dimensional problem space. A house is definitely not just any house shaped
          geometry, and before we even enter the realm of architecture, there's structural
          engineering, business, regulatory and legal criteria that a house must satisfy. For such a
          tall order, we assumed that even a smartly designed learning algorithm will have to do
          many iterations, getting feedback from a myriad of evaluators (structural,
          sunlight/daylight, acoustic, business, legal) until it reaches a solution.

          So we generate stuff, evaluate, generate new stuff, evaluate, and so on, until eventually we stop
          after either all criteria are satisfied, no significant improvement can be found, or we exceeded our
          computational budget. And because the problem is going to be hard, we need to use that budget
          well. At the time we weren't quite sure whether we need to be fast so that we have a shot at being
          quasi-realtime, or to at least finish the computation overnight on a powerful hardware [1].

            [1]: The state as of me leaving the company is that for small scenes it took seconds to
            get something, and minutes to get something useful. This degraded to having to do
            overnight runs for large and huge scenes. The problem is hard.

          The thing we focused on first was one particularly computationally demanding part of the
          evaluation process: the daylight evaluation. For the uninitiated, it is something that
          tells you how much light accumulates on surfaces in the interior of a building for some
          stable lighting conditions outside. This is done for up to tens of thousands of surfaces
          inside many rooms and many buildings in a city block, both in the buildings you plan to
          build, and in the already existing buildings that surround them [2].

          The way daylight evaluation is usually implemented today is raytracing. Interestingly
          enough, all software solutions that existed back then
          (<a href="https://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug.html">Ladybug</a>, <a href="https://www.solemma.com/climatestudio">Climate
          Studio</a>) internally depend on a raytracing package
          called <a href="https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/tree/master">Radiance</a>, and for
          various reasons, both Radiance itself and the way it is integrated into products is a few
          orders of magnitude too slow to be useful as a machine learning feedback function [3]. We
          believed those orders of magnitude could be reclaimed, and thus our first quest was to
          build a fast daylight evaluator for our internal use
          [4].

            at around 500 million rays per second. Not too bad for a CPU. (I very scientifically

          To bridge this closer to videogame audience, daylight evaluation is very similar to what
          game developers call light baking: computing light simulation for static scenes and baking
          the results into planar (lightmaps) or spatial (light probes) textures, so that we know
          how a scene is lit without having to compute it at runtime. The differences between
          daylight evaluation and light baking come down to how the results are used, not how they
          are computed. Compared to light baking, daylight evaluation doesn't care about color, only
          intensity, nor does it need to produce information about which direction the light is
          coming from for the light probes. Daylighting also only needs to simulate perfectly
          diffuse (Lambertian) materials, making some parts of the job simpler. There's also a few
          peripheral bits about interpreting the results that are specific to the AEC industry. I am
          going to purposefully ignore these, and instead focus on raytracing, which I believe looks
          the same as it would in a computer graphics application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ray tracing is a process of simulating light. For a point in space, for instance a pixel on a chip
          of a digital camera, we want to determine the intensity and color of light that point receives. We
          do that by simulating paths that light could have taken through the scene from a light source to
          reach our point. Such paths can be either direct, or include one or more bounces from objects in the
          scene. However, we are often interested in light reaching just a few select points in space, like
          the chip of our digital camera. Compared to all the places the light can go, light rays have only a
          miniscule chance of reaching the points we are interested in, directly or via bounces. In other
          words, we would have to shoot a lot of rays from light sources for them to trickle down to our
          measurement points in sufficient quantities.

          Instead, we lean on laws of the universe regarding (the absence of) the arrow of time for the
          behavior of particles. If we were shown a movie of elementary particles moving through space,
          perhaps sometimes colliding with each other, we would have a hard time telling, whether the movie is
          playing forward or backward. This is because it is impossible to tell - they follow the same rules
          whether they are moving forward or backward in time, and it is only possible to discern the
          direction of time once we have a large number of particles and probability enters the picture,
          pushing particles towards states with high entropy [5]. For us, this means that if we have
          a path between a measurement point and a light source, a photon could have taken that exact path in
          both directions [6].

        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [5]: The fundamental laws for particles do not change when there's many of them. The
            probabilistic behavior arises from our inability to keep track large data, leading us to
            reason about macrostates and entropy instead. Also note that this has nothing to do with
            quantum mechanics, which plays a role a much finer scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            [6]: This is an oversimplification on many levels. Photons do not necessarily bounce off
            of all surfaces. Sometimes they are absorbed, and a new photon is emitted. However,
            there is a grain of truth in this model, and imagining photons as "zillions of bouncing
            billiard balls" doesn't disrupt our high level simulation.

          The implication of bidirectionality for our simulation is that we can trace rays in
          reverse: from the relatively few points we are interested in towards light sources. For
          infinite number of rays we would have reached the same answer either way, but with our
          finite limitations, we have a higher chance of successfully completing the path between
          the light source and the camera going backwards [7]. With both forward and reverse
          raytracing, we keep track of how much energy we lose each bounce. Because these energy
          losses (also called attenuation) multiply, and multiplication is commutative, this works
          out the same regardless of the direction we trace the ray in.

      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [7]: Because light sources are usually bigger than our camera, and even if the ray
            escapes the scene, we can sample a background skybox to get some ambient value of light.

      <div>
        <p>
          So we trace rays from our measurement points, hoping they eventually reach sources of
          light. These rays go in a straight line until they hit something. Depending on what was
          hit, various things happen.

          If the ray hits a light reflecting surface, it bounces off of it, back into the scene. The
          new direction of the ray depends on the physical properties of the surface. Some surfaces
          reflect the ray as a mirror would, others deflect the ray in a random direction, and there
          are more complicated behaviors for realistic materials, described by the material's
          Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). A BRDF can be quite complex
          [8], and cannot always be defined by a mathematical formula. For many realistic
          materials, the BRDF is actually a lookup table [9], measured by putting the material in
          a Gonioreflectometer.

          <p>
            [8]: For instance, the BRDF for animal fur behaves differently for various orientations of
            the incoming and outgoing rays relative to the surface.

          If the ray hits a light source, it ends its journey. We read the light's value and apply
          the attenuation the ray has accumulated when bouncing off of materials along its
          path. Because each bounce attenuates the ray, we also can decide to terminate the ray
          early after a certain amount of bounces, because even if it did reach a light source
          eventually, the light's contribution through that particular ray would have been close to
          zero. (XXX: Include this in the picture above?)

          Hopefully multiple rays shot from our camera reach light sources. We compute the light
          value reaching the camera's pixel as the sum of individual ray contributions divided by
          the number of cast rays. Because scenes are not always well lit, it may take a lot of rays
          for us to form a coherent picture of what the scene looks like from the perspective of the
          camera. Low light scenes are prone to noise, when various neighboring pixels in the camera
          collect dramatically different values of light due to randomness of bounces. As the number
          of rays increases to infinity, the noise becomes weaker, but because a large number of
          rays is not always practical, we often employ denoising algorithms that reconstruct
          information from noisy pictures. Denoising is an important part of modern raytracing,
          because it lets us spend a fixed cost to substantially improve the result quality that
          would otherwise have to be improved by shooting unreasonable amounts of rays. It might
          have also been useful in our usecase [10], but we simply didn't have the time to pursue
          it.

            [10]: Thinking back, denoising would have been interesting for us, because our raytracer
            collected light in half-sphere shaped light probes, so essentially we would have been
            denoising black &amp; white fish-eye pictures.

        <h2>Raytracer Architecture, Appetizer</h2>

        <p>
          At a high level, a raytracer operates on a geometric description of the scene and a list
          of rays it needs to compute on that scene. These do not necessarily change at the same
          rate from frame to frame, and many real-time raytracers reason about that (but we won't).

      </div>
      <div></div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The simplest and most flexible way to represent the scene is to have arrays of various
          geometric primitives: triangles, spheres, planes, boxes... Raytracing the scene is about
          going over each ray and testing [11] it against all of these arrays, remembering
          information about the closest hit, so that we know where to start our next bounce. In
          fact, this is so simple that almost all of it fits in pseudocode.

            [11]: Testing rays against geometry means solving an equation for the two parametric
            geometries, like ray and sphere. The solve provides us with both the distance to the
            intersection point and the normal of the intersected surface, both of which we need to
            proceed. The math and code for these is delayed until the section Raytracer

          Before addressing the elephant in the room and moving on from this approach, I want to
          mention some of its benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
        Firstly, this code listing is almost all there is to it! You have the arrays of objects, and you
        loop over them. Or, if you don't have data in the exact right shape, you can organize it into those
        arrays easily. This is not going to be true for the later, more sophisticated designs. There is
        beauty in simplicity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div></div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Another virtue of the scene laid out in arrays is that the resulting code is very
          straightforward to optimize. We can very easily start thinking about packing the arrays
          such that each cache line of geometry we load is not going to be wasted [12].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [12]: For most software, the major source of slowness is getting data from memory to the
            CPU. Thinking about CPU caches and architecting programs around them can lead to
            significant speedups by itself.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          We can also quite easily make the code SIMD. Going wide can happen either over rays or
          geometries. When going wide over rays, we not only get the obvious benefit of testing
          multiple rays against geometry, but there is also a subtler compounding effect: we get a
          lot more value out of each geometry we load, because we test it against multiple rays at a
          time. Problems arise with some rays finishing after less bounces than others, making the
          contents of our wide registers be both active and finished rays. We either have to do
          something about that [13], or accept the wasted work. Going wide over rays was the route
          taken by Casey Muratori in his <a href="https://guide.handmadehero.org/ray/">Handmade Ray
          educational miniseries</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [13]: After we have made a pass over all geometry and we know which rays hit what, we
            could write out the results for finished rays and load in new ones into our wide
            registers. This would incur some management and complexity overhead, but would also mean
            we utilize memory and SIMD to the fullest right until the very end where we run out of
            rays to swap in.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Unlike parallelizing on rays, going wide over geometry doesn't ameliorate the cost of
          memory traffic to the CPU. Each wide geometric primitive is loaded to be tested against a
          ray, evicted by subsequent loads [14], only to be loaded again when the next ray is
          going to need that exact same memory. It still is an improvement over the non-SIMD
          version, as we at least compute more intersections at a time. It is also simpler to think
          about (unless you think about SIMD a lot), because the nature of the code is still mostly
          scalar and you only do SIMD to accelerate select parts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [14]: The exact level of eviction (register file, L1, L2, ...) gets worse with the size
            of the working set.

      <div>
        <p>
          Now back to the elephant, which is algorithmic in nature. We are visiting each geometry for each ray
          bounce, but most of those rays have no way to reach most geometries. This incurs many wasted loads
          and calculations per bounce. To get away from the O(m*n), we use acceleration structures to help
          with eliminating impossible hits, such as Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) or Octrees. Choosing a
          datastructure depends on the character of your data. We went with the BVH, because it doesn't have
          many assumptions and degrades gracefully with bad quality of input [15].
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [15]: We didn't want to constrain the rest of what we are going to build by choosing an
            overly picky datastructure. This also helped us productize the daylighting evaluator later.

        <h2>Raytracer Architecture, Main Course</h2>

        <p>
          The BVH is a tree where each node has bounding volume geometrically containing the node's
          contents. This bounding volume is usually a parametric shape, such as an axis-aligned box
          or a sphere. The node's contents are either links to child nodes, or in case of leaf nodes
          actual geometries. Note that a node's bounding volume only has a relation to the node's
          contents, but there is no direct relation between the bounding volumes of two sibling tree
          nodes. Two sibling nodes can very well have overlapping bounding volumes, both of which
          are contained inside the parent's bounding volume. This means that traversing a BVH can
          take multiple paths at the same time, as they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive,
          unlike in binary search trees.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div></div>

      <div>
        <p>
          In practice, a bounding volume can be any volumetric geometry [16] and the leaf nodes can
          store whatever we want, but our raytracer used axis-aligned bounding boxes and triangles,
          so we are going to do the same here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="sidenote">
          <p>
            [16]: In addition to axis-aligned bounding boxes, bounding spheres and oriented bounding
            boxes are also often used. Choosing is about making a tradeoff between how much culling
            the bounding volume does compared to its memory footprint. Spheres are smallest in
            memory, but do least culling. Oriented boxes do the most culling, but take up the most
            storage, and also someone has to do the work of finding the best orientation. We went
            with axis-aligned boxes, because they are simple and reasonably good.

          Testing rays against a BVH is not all that different to what we have been doing until
          now. We are still going to be keeping track of the closest hit, which is one of the
          triangles in the leaf nodes. To get to those triangles, we traverse the tree, testing
          against each node's bounding volume. However, we only visit child nodes, if the ray
          intersects with the parent node's volume. Once we get to a leaf node, we test our ray
          against the node's geometry, recording track of the closest hit distance and normal. Once
          we know the closest hit distance, we can use it to eliminate entire branches of the tree,
          because we can skip over nodes not just when we miss their bounding volume, but also if
          the distance to that bounding volume is greater than the recorded closest hit distance. It
          is worthwhile to traverse the tree depth first, so that we record our closest hit as soon
          as possible, eliminating further tests down the line.

          Building a BVH is just a little more complicated than using it. I mentioned previously that a node's
          bounding volume has no relation to bounding volumes of sibling nodes. This makes it a little easier
          to build a bad-but-correct BVH. For a good BVH, we'd also like to minimize the volume each node
          takes, and make bounding volumes of sibling nodes overlap less. We'll work on building a good BVH
          later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting with an array of triangles, we begin building the hierarchy by conceptually putting all the
          triangles into a single BVH node. We then recursively split nodes until the number of triangles they
          contain is below a predefined threshold.

          Now the raytracer scales logarithmically with the size of the scene. However, by naively
          entering the land of computer science, we have temporarily lost our ability to utilize modern
          hardware, and have to do some thinking to recover it.
        </p>

        <h2>Raytracer Architecture, Second Main Course</h2>

        <p>
          While the raytracer now has good scaling with the size of the scene, we are not utilizing
          any intra-core parallelism yet, which is a theoretical 4x/8x (perhaps more, if you are
          reading this in the future) within our reach. Currently, each ray has to traverse the BVH,
          test against the axis-aligned bounding boxes of its nodes, and for each leaf also test
          against each triangle, one scalar battle after another.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's two general avenues of improvement we could explore from here, analogous to the
          simple array architecture from earlier: parallelizing on rays, or parallelizing on
          geometry traversal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, in 2023 I wasn't smart enough to figure out the ray-parallel design that
          would also include a BVH, and even today I am not sure it would work out all that well. My
          sketch version has several problems right off the bat. It would require SIMD gather, which
          is at least AVX2 on x64, and I am not sure if a NEON equivalent even exists. Moreover, the
          gather instructions would likely be doing loads from wildly different memory addresses
          (and thus cache lines), and they would still be subject to physical limitations like
          memory bandwidth. On top of all that, we'd have maintain a traversal stack per SIMD
          lane... When put together, this seems troublesome. It may still be possible, and if anyone
          actually did this, I'd love to know what you did.
        </p>

        <p>
          But instead we are going to go the obvious way, SIMD crunching multiple geometries against
          a single ray. While you can readily imagine how we'd SIMD-ify testing rays against
          triangles in leaf nodes, the more interesting part is applying SIMD to test the bounding
          volumes. The most obvious challenge here is that the data is not even remotely organized
          to do this. The bounding boxes are stored in nodes of a binary tree, each node floating
          who knows where in memory. However, what if we could reshape the tree such that it is
          essentially the same tree, but the bounding boxes we test against are laid out next to
          each other?

      </div>
      <div><!-- EMPTY --></div>

      <div>
        <p>
          The transform we are going to do involves changing the tree's branching factor, as well as
          pulling the child nodes' bounding volumes into the parent node. In some sense, this is the
          core idea of the raytracer codebase (and this article). At the time I was very happy that
          I came up with it on my own, but it looks obvious in hindsight. Cursory internet search
          says other people also do this [17].

          However, before we get to the exciting wide BVH, there is one last piece of housekeeping. In the

          Since we are about to do SIMD (which arguably means rolling up our sleeves and becoming serious programmers), we
          would like to leave the heterogeneous tree nodes behind. There's two problems with the union in our nodes, the main one
          being the memory we have to load when we walk the tree. We want to make sure that each loaded byte and
          cache line counts. Towards that end, we would like to have the nodes contain only what we need,
          align them to cache lines and make sure they do not straddle cache line boundaries. This is not
          impossible to do for the heterogeneous tree, but at least for me it is simpler to think about it
          without the overlay. The second problem is memory use. This is not such a big deal today
          [18], but still it would be nice if we allocated only what we used.

          Our new BVH has two kinds of nodes, each stored in their own array. The inner nodes contain indices

          Now we are ready to make our BVH wide.
        </p>

        <p>
          From now on, the code snippets will target AVX hardware (8-wide), because the cache line
          math works out nicely compared to the 4-wide SSE. We could just as well build
          SSE/NEON (4-wide) or AVX-512 (16-wide) versions of the data structures. In fact, later in
          the article we talk about how multiple implementations can coexist side by side and
          produce the same results.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make the BVH wide, we restructure it slightly. I am going to do so in steps to make it
          easier to follow. First imagine the node's bounding volume is not stored in the node
          itself, but its parent. For the root node, we omit a bounding volume altogether and say it
          is always reachable.
        </p>

        <pre>
Inner_Node :: struct {
    left_bbox:  AABox;
    right_bbox: AABox;

    left_index:  BVH_Index;
    right_index: BVH_Index;
}
        </pre>

        <p>
          With nodes storing the bounding boxes of their child nodes, we now know whether our ray
          will hit the child nodes before we visit them. More importantly, the bounding boxes are
          now stored next to each other, and we could process them both at the same time. In fact,
          if we stopped here, it is possible that the out-of-order window would be large enough so
          that the CPU would schedule both intersection tests in parallel.

          But why stop at two:
        </p>

        <pre>
Inner_Node_X8 :: struct {
    child_bbox0: AABox;
    child_bbox1: AABox;

    child_index5: BVH_Index;

    child_index7: BVH_Index;
}
        </pre>

        <p>
          Now that all that data is snugly together, all that's left before we vectorize is to align
          stuff. We might as well factor out the 8-wide axis-aligned box type, since that is what
          our intersection routine will be operating on. The final version of the wide node:
        </p>

        <pre>
AABox_Pack_X8 :: struct {
    min: Vec3x8;   #align 64
    max: Vec3x8;
}

// The node is aligned to the x64 cache line size, and spans 4 cache lines.
Inner_Node_X8 :: struct {
    // Hot, 3 cache lines
    aabox_pack: AABox_Pack_X8;
    // Also likely hot, 1 cache line
    child_indices: [8] BVH_Index;
}
        </pre>

        <p>
          With the 8-wide bounding box, we need a new intersection routine, but the interface is
          similar to the old one:

          Compared to organizing the tree for SIMD, once we crunch through the tree and reach the
          triangles stored in leaves, going wide is fairly straightforward. One slight subtlety is
          that instead of triangle count, we are going to have a triangle mask instead, which nicely
          pads the memory to 5 cache lines. The struct defining the leaf node looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
Leaf_Node_X8 :: struct {
    // Hot, 5 cache lines
    triangle_pack: Triangle_Pack_X8;
    triangle_mask: u32x8;

    // Cold, 2 cache lines. We could also store materials out of band.
    materials: [8] Material;
}

    v0: Vec3x8;    #align 64;
    v1: Vec3x8;

}

        <p>
          Analogously to bounding boxes, we also need a new math routine for triangles:

          Note that right now we can not configure leaf heaviness with LEAF_TRIANGLE_COUNT, so let's restore
          that by modifying the BVH_Index pointing into leaf_nodes to have a 2:31:31 (tag:start:end)
          structure, allowing us to index a span of leaf nodes. Now, as long as our LEAF_TRIANGLE_COUNT is a
          multiple of 8, we can once again say how deep or heavy the tree is [19].

            [19]: Why is this important? This is a hyperparameter you can tune. For our final
            version of the code it ended up being 8, but the reason was consistency of results
            between the SIMD implementations. The AVX backend actually benefitted speed-wise from
            having 16 triangles in a leaf (and you can imagine AVX-512 benefiting even more), but we
            wanted our BVH to have the same shape across implementations, so this number ended up
            being a compromise between SSE/NEON and AVX. The consistency argument is maybe not all
            that strong, it depends on how much you want to radiate the impression of deterministic
            software. We wanted to have the same results, and the simplest way to achieve that was
            to have the tree look the same, otherwise ordering of leaf nodes and triangles within
            could cause a ray to reflect elsewhere. Maybe there was something smarter we could have done,
            I don't know.

          Now that we defined the new structure of the tree, we need to adjust both the code that
          builds it and the code that traverses it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The build code is fairly boring, but also verbose, so I won't write it out in pseudocode
          this time. The new build function has to split nodes 8-way. It does this by doing multiple
          splits for each node, first splitting the triangles into two groups, then splitting those
          into four, and finally splitting those once again. It computes a bounding box for each
          group of triangles and writes it in the current node. Something that couldn't have
          happened for regular BVHs, but often happens for wide ones is not having enough triangles
          for the 8-way split. When this happens, some bounding boxes are going to be empty (zero
          size, positioned at zero), and their corresponding indices will have the TAG_NIL. Empty
          bounding boxes will fail intersection tests, and just in case we made an error in the
          math code, the TAG_NIL tells us we can not follow that index.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can, however, write out the pseudocode for traversing the wide BVH. If you squint, it
          isn't all that different to what we have been doing so far:

        <p>
          And that's a wrap! The next section is going to tie up some loose ends I didn't manage to weave in
          here, but otherwise this is a fairly complete picture of SIMD-ifying your raytracer. I unfortunately
          don't have the measurements from back when we were doing this, but have re-measured the scalar, SSE,
          and AVX backends of the raytracer now.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a small scene (the entire BVH fits in the L3 of Ryzen 5950X), going from scalar to SSE was about
          2.1x speedup, and going from SSE to AVX was another 1.3X speedup. The same multipliers are also true
          for a large scene (400 megabytes of BVH), which I admit is a little strange, as I expected the
          difference between L3 and main memory to be more pronounced. Perhaps I should craft a scene that
          would fit the L1 or L2 to see if anything changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to end on one obvious benefit and one less obvious drawback of the wide BVH, which might even
          partially explain the diminishing returns in speed observed above. Let's start with the good. The
          wider your BVH, the less nodes you have, and thus less bounding boxes and less indices. On the
          extreme, it might even help and push your scene into a better cache class (e.g. L3 -> L2), apart
          from improving the memory footprint.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bad news is, the fatter your nodes, the more memory bandwidth is required to load each one. The
          8-wide nodes occupy four x64 cache lines. 16-wide nodes would have been eight cache lines. This
          starts becoming a problem, when most of your intersection tests fail (which most of them should, if
          your BVH is any good). You loaded all those boxes, only to to realize that the ray does not intersect
          them. To measure the impact here, we could instrument the code with a metric of average read cache
          lines per bounce. We'd likely see that the wider we go, the worse that metric becomes, eventually
          negating the benefits of wide traversal. I haven't actually done this, so maybe I should, before I
          say untrue things on the internet.

        <h2>Raytracer Architecture, Dessert</h2>

        <p>
          This section is not yet written. I want to talk about these miscellaneous things in it:
        </p>

        <pre>
- Explain the slab method and its SIMD form. https://tavianator.com/2022/ray_box_boundary.html.
- Explain Moller-Trumbore and its SIMD form. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm
- SAH optimization (Credit DH)
- Sort bounding boxes before pushing on stack.
- Targeting multiple SIMD backends within one binary: avx2, sse2, neon, fallback
- Making sure the multiple backends return the same results -> tree structure must be the same, FMA
  must be either forced or disallowed for all backends
- Threading: job per light probe (~thousands of rays)
- Memory allocation: in what places does a raytracer allocate? how can we make the allocation cheap (on stack arrays, arenas).
- Would avx512 help? 16-wide BVH means a lot of memory traffic. How many cache lines do we have to
  read on average for a single ray? And how many 512-bit loads?
- Compress BVH to f16? I tried this once, and it was slow AF. I don't remember why exactly. Could be
  that the boxes were less tight, causing more traversal. Could be that I made a mistake. I also did
  the f16 decode manually, but there is wide F16->F32 decode in AVX-512 (which I didn't have access to).
- What about metropolis, monte carlo estimation, etc...
        </pre>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I hereby conclude the conclusion.
