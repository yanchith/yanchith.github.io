          <b>2025 Update:</b> Looking at this text today, my tastes about what is good software, art
          or writing have changed. I would do many technical and interpersonal aspects of the
          project differently, and I would not be writing about it in this voice. But growing up is
          part of the process, and the post is now a sort of time capsule of the past me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://sub.digital/project02">BA 2022 model</a> is a
          commercial project I worked on
          with <a href="https://sub.digital">Subdigital</a> and Abaffy Design
          for <a href="https://hbreavis.com/">HB Reavis</a> in 2017. It fuses
          design, engineering and software to explain the connection of large
          real-estate development to its surroundings in the city of
          Bratislava. The model's 3x4K screen shows a stylized animated map of
          the city. The presenter interacts with the model via a connected
          mobile tablet and controls what the map shows.
        </p>

        <p>
          While not initially intended, the engine in the model ended up being
          mostly a compositor of animated layers (each potentially running
          internal simulations) that could be turned on and off
          individually. Blending animated layers was a simple mental model for
          representing features in the engine - every user-visible feature is a
          either an data-controlled animated layer or a blend thereof.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even in idling state with no active highlights set by the presenter,
          the model still displays a lot of RNG-guided moving elements like
          transportation and pedestrians. While we knew we would have powerful
          consumer hardware available, we still wanted to be conservative with
          the CPU and GPU budget so we partially specialized and precomputed
          simulation and animation data offline whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of the requirement to render HTML and the fact that the team
          was mostly familiar with web technologies at the time, the engine runs
          on (carefully written subset of) TypeScript and paints pixels via WebGL and a
          small amount of Chromium-rendered SVG. While that wouldn't be my
          choice for what is basically an embedded project today, I am still
          grateful for the iteration speed it gave us.
