          <a href="https://issuu.com/subdigital/docs/subdigital_studio/80">Walkers</a>
          is a single purpose interactive installation built by Ján Pernecký and
          me to support
          an <a href="https://www.archinfo.sk/kalendarium/julia-jurinova-denniky.html">exhibition
          of Júlia Jurinová</a> in 2018. We scanned people walking around the
          exhibition with Kinect and asynchronously processed their point cloud
          data to be interpolable by matching vertices between scan
          frames. Finally, we projected the frame interpolations of the
          collected scans on a wall in slow motion, rendered as particles with
          CRT persistence post-processing effect applied to make them look
          ghostly, each visitor leaving an imprint of themselves behind.

          Because this was a one-shot project with an extremely narrow scope,
          the whole creation process took about a week and we threw many of the
          coding "best practices" out of the window. There was no code review or
          code sharing, we worked on separate parts (Ján on geometry processing
          and me on rendering) with just a shared directory on the file system
          as the interaction API between our programs. Expecting to find a
          horrible mess, I was surprised when I looked at the source for the
          renderer program today. It is surprisingly clean and simple, does
          exactly one thing and does it in a very concrete way, using just
          the <a href="https://github.com/yanchith/webglutenfree">Webglutenfree</a>
          library (built in-house for previous projects). While not really proud
          for using Electron as the platform layer (and would probably hand-roll
          a native platform layer today), it once again worked well.
