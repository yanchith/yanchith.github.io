          Project Pointy Hat is a prototype of a block pushing puzzle game being
          worked on by <a href="./index.html">me</a>
          and <a href="#credits">friends</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was born out of a discussion
          with <a href="https://twitter.com/fannasm">Stefan</a> and me. The idea
          is to have an honest puzzle game (the
          way <a href="https://twitter.com/mvandevander">Matthew VanDevander</a>
          defines it), but with a CRPG feeling. That turned out to be rather
          difficult.

          It has been a year since we started, and the game is very far from
          done. In fact, there are still major design questions in the game that
          need answering, but we promised our institutional patrons to release
          something. So we are releasing a super raw version of the game from
          the state it was in around August 2022. With the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is this for? At the moment, I don't think anyone besides hardcore
          puzzle game players and programmers will enjoy what's inside these
          packages - and in fact, hardcore puzzle gamers might think the game is
          objectively bad and hardcore programmers might laugh at the source
          code. The game looks like programmer art, doesn't sound like anything,
          the order of levels doesn't facilitate learning of the mechanics, and
          is an overall bad experience. The source code is in a weird state
          too. A lot of the game is is still unformed, so I (the programmer)
          have been keeping the code hot and easy to change. Thus only a small
          number of tiny abstractions have crystallized so far. Notable
          exceptions are: guise, the immediate mode UI library (not in tree, but
          can already be
          found <a href="https://github.com/yanchith/guise">here</a>), the
          linear allocator (lfg_alloc), and the allocator-aware serialization
          library (lfg_cereal). While structuring the code this way is very good
          for me when working on it, this situation is likely bad for anyone
          trying to extract structure and meaning from the code.

          That said, we still aspire to make this a good game. The kind that
          people will find lots of interesting ideas in (our inspirations are
          games by Thekla, Draknek, increpare and more), but also be able to
          just slow down and take in this strange world we have built. And if we
          manage to do that, we'll likely re-release the source without the art
          assets in a much better form, so that future generations of people
          brave enough to build games from scratch will have a few more examples
          to look at.

          Now, without further ado, let's break down the packages:
          <p>
              <a href="project-pointy-hat-win32.zip">project-pointy-hat-win32.zip</a>
              contains the Windows game executable and the assets. It requires
              either D3D12 or Vulkan to run.
          </p>
          <p>
              <a href="project-pointy-hat-source.zip">project-pointy-hat-source.zip</a>
              contains the game source and the assets. The game is written in a
              low-level subset of Rust, can be built like a regular Cargo
              project. Everything should just work, but if you are looking at
              this from the far future, things might have bitrotted somewhat.
