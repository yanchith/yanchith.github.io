        <h1>Wave Function Collapse</h1>
        <h2>A WFC Solver and Grasshopper plugin with Subdigital</h2>
        <p class='mt25'>

          <!-- TODO(yan): Link to Subdigital WFC -->
          <!-- TODO(yan): Link to repository once published -->

          <!-- TODO(yan): Check name spelling -->
          In 2020, Subdigital hosted a summer intership with the aim to develop
          and utilize a discrete materialization method of data-driven design
          with available fabrication technology. We picked a method already well
          known in the game development industry thanks to people like Maxim
          Gumin and Oskar Stalberg, but still reasonably under-exploited at the
          time in the fields of computational design and architecture: Wave
          Function Collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ján Pernecký and I created the software tools necessary for the
          intersnhip students to experiment with the method. We opted to make
          the WFC solver a plugin for Grasshopper, an node based programming
          language for computationally creating shapes and forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Ján Pernecký tackled the UI of the tool (a much harder problem
          deserving its own blog post), I worked mostly on the WFC Solver
          itself. To enable fast iteration for designers, we knew the tool
          needed to respond to parameter changes almost real-time. The heavy
          lifting was therefore implemented in Rust and loaded into Grasshopper
          as a DLL. Inside the library itself, WFC slots and the modules they
          contained were represented as compact bit vectors of 256 bits and
          operated on by just a handful of bitwise instructions and bit-counting
          intrinsics. While initially worried about the 256 limit on the WFC
          module count, our students' projects never reached this limit in
          practice.

        <h1>H.U.R.B.A.N. Selector</h1>
        <h2>An experimental procedural geometry modeling and morphing tool</h2>
        <p class='mt25'>
          H.U.R.B.A.N Selector is a software experiment sponsored by the Slovak
          Design Center. It is meant to test the hypothesis that creating new
          designs and shapes is subconsciously inspired by our previous
          experience. There is a trial and error phase in the design process
          where many variations on the same shape are prototyped and chosen
          from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The software is currently in very early stages, but as it nears
          completion, it will strive to be a tool for simple parametric
          modeling, containing implementations of various morphing strategies
          for mesh models, allowing designers to smoothly interpolate between
          multiple mesh geometries and select the result with the most desired
          features.

        <h1>Bratislava 2022 Model</h1>
        <h2>Interactive urban model of Bratislava, Slovakia</h2>
        <!-- TODO(yan): BA2022 link -->
        <!-- TODO(yan): Subdigital link -->
        <!-- TODO(yan): Abaffy link -->
        <!-- TODO(yan): HB Reavis link -->
        <p class='mt25'>
          The BA 2022 model is a commercial project I worked on with Subdigital
          and Abaffy Design for HB Reavis in 2017. It fuses design, engineering
          and software to explain the connection of large real-estate
          development to its surroundings in the city of Bratislava. The model's
          3x4K screen displays a stylized animated map of the city. The
          presenter interacts with the model via a connected mobile tablet and
          controls what the map shows.
        </p>

        <p>
          While not initially intended, the "engine" in the model ended up being
          mostly a compositor of animated layers (each internally running its
          simulation) that could be turned on and off individually. Blending
          animated layers was a simple mental model of representing features in
          the software.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even in idling state with no active highlights set by
          the presenter, the model still displays a lot of PRNG-guided moving
          elements like transportation and pedestrians. While we knew we would
          have a powerful computer available, we still wanted to be conservative
          with the CPU and GPU budget so we employed partial specialization and
          precomputed simulation and animation data offline whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of the requirement to render html and the fact that the team
          was mostly familiar with web technologies at the time, the software in
          the model runs on (carefully written) Javascript and paints pixels via
          WebGL and a small amount of SVG rendered by Chromium. While that
          wouldn't be my choice for what is basically an embedded project today,
          I am still grateful for the iteration speed that gave us.
