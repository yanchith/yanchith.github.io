          I am an independent programmer and designer in love with virtual
          worlds and game development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in first principles thinking, and that programmers should
          not be adding artificial complexity to the programs they create. I do
          have academic appreciation for strange and abstract things, but
          lately I prefer simpler tools where the programmer can understand what
          is going on under the hood.

          I am particularly proud of my contribution to the realization of
          <a href="https://cfoeg.online">celestialfruit.org</a> with
          <a href="https://jonathanreus.com">Jonathan Reus</a>. The
          installation is an ongoing and open interactive artwork. It’s
          conceived as a living tapestry of visual and sonic traces gathered
          through artistic collaborations and micro-commissions.

          The work focuses on the five-string banjo, a historically complex
          musical instrument that can be thought of as a map of
          material-embodied cultures, packed with the stories and ideas of
          people; their migrations and exchanges. Moving around through an
          online virtual universe, the visitor navigates and reassembles these
          elements in a way that mirrors the transmission and transformations of
          culture itself as a living, moving, and complex entity. Besides the
          interactive experience, the work also operates as a method and engine
          for driving future collaborations at the meeting points of musical
          instruments, technology, and tradition.
        </p>

          This collaboration flexed my programming muscles in more than one
          way. It might be my first finished project where experimentation and
          changing the feature set regularly was the go to modus operandi
          instead of something unwelcome. During the three-month initial
          development period, I had to keep some semblance of structure while
          not overoptimizing or locking myself into a design corner. It sort of
          worked and I am not terribly unhappy with the resulting codebase,
          although the amount of cleanup tasks this produced is daunting. I am
          sure I'll get to that backlog one day (:
        </p>

        <p>
          Having to implement a data driven scene building system and an
          animation system with simple scripting all over again makes me think
          whether I should finally bite the bullet and learn a game engine like
          Godot or Unreal instead of always rolling my own. I do admit that the
          tight time constraints made me step outside of my comfort zone and use
          way more framework-ey libraries than I otherwise would. The experience
          was as expected: there were a lot of out-of-the-box features, and a
          lot of out-of-the-box bugs. If I had to guess, the features still
          outweighted the extra trouble, even if it made me grumpy at times.

        <p class="mt25">
          In 2020, <a href="https://sub.digital">Subdigital</a> hosted a summer
          internship with the aim to develop and utilize a discrete
          materialization method of data-driven design with available
          fabrication technology. We picked Wave Function Collapse - a method
          already well known in the game development community thanks to people
          like <a href="https://twitter.com/ExUtumno">Maxim Gumin</a>
          and <a href="https://twitter.com/OskSta">Oskar Stålberg</a>, but still
          somewhat under-exploited at the time in the fields of computational
          design and architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ján Pernecký and I created the software tools necessary for the
          internship students to experiment with the method. We opted to make
          the WFC solver a plugin
          for <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/">Grasshopper</a>, an node
          based programming language for computationally creating shapes and
          forms.

          That initial summer exploration was later expanded on. Driven by usage
          experience and over the course of many observations, Ján Pernecký
          collapsed his original WFC tools
          into <a href="https://monoceros.sub.digital">Monoceros</a>, a full
          fledged Grasshopper plugin.
        </p>

        <p>
          While my own work on Monoceros amounted to mostly brainstorming and
          rubber-ducking, I am glad it still uses the original solver from the
          summer because of the optimization work that went into it. To enable
          fast iteration for designers, we knew the tool needed to respond to
          parameter changes quickly, ideally real-time. The heavy lifting is
          therefore implemented in Rust and loaded into Grasshopper as a
          DLL. Inside the library itself, WFC slots and the modules they
          contained were represented as compact bit vectors of 256 bits and
          operated on by just a handful of bitwise instructions and bit-counting
          intrinsics. While initially worried about the 256 limit on the WFC
          module count, the projects rarely reach this limit in practice. A
          future extension might be to fall back to a less compact (and
          therefore possibly slower) representation for definitions with large
          module counts.
