        <h1>Wave Function Collapse</h1>
        <h2>A WFC Solver and Grasshopper plugin with Subdigital</h2>
        <p class='mt25'>

          In 2020, Subdigital hosted a summer intership with the aim to develop
          and utilize a discrete materialization method of data-driven design
          with available fabrication technology. We picked a method already well
          known in the game development industry thanks to people like Maxim
          Gumin and Oskar Stalberg, but still reasonably under-exploited at the
          time in the fields of computational design and architecture: Wave
          Function Collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ján Pernecký and I created the software tools necessary for the
          intersnhip students to experiment with the method. We opted to make
          the WFC solver a plugin for Grasshopper, an node based programming
          language for computationally creating shapes and forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Ján Pernecký tackled the UI of the tool (a much harder problem
          deserving its own blog post), I worked mostly on the WFC Solver
          itself. To enable fast iteration for designers, we knew the tool
          needed to respond to parameter changes almost real-time. The heavy
          lifting was therefore implemented in Rust and loaded into Grasshopper
          as a DLL. Inside the library itself, WFC slots and the modules they
          contained were represented as compact bit vectors of 256 bits and
          operated on by just a handful of bitwise instructions and bit-counting
          intrinsics. While initially worried about the 256 limit on the WFC
          module count, our students' projects never reached this limit in
          practice.

        <h1>H.U.R.B.A.N. Selector</h1>
        <h2>An experimental procedural geometry modeling and morphing tool</h2>
        <p class='mt25'>
          H.U.R.B.A.N Selector is a software experiment sponsored by the Slovak
          Design Center. It is meant to test the hypothesis that creating new
          designs and shapes is subconsciously inspired by our previous
          experience. There is a trial and error phase in the design process
          where many variations on the same shape are prototyped and chosen
          from.
        </p>

        <p>
          The software is currently in very early stages, but as it nears
          completion, it will strive to be a tool for simple parametric
          modeling, containing implementations of various morphing strategies
          for mesh models, allowing designers to smoothly interpolate between
          multiple mesh geometries and select the result with the most desired
          features.
